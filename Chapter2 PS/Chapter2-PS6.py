#Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user

a = int(input("Enter the number to get the square of it: "))

print(a*a)
print(a**2) #does the same thing, just here we have initialized the exponent as 2 which means getting square of the number 
print(pow(a,2)) #library/module used to get the square of a number
